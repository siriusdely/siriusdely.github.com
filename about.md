I am a Software Developer for Web & Mobile Applications, who is working remotely as a Senior Engineer for Smart Walkie Pte. Ltd., a Telecommunication Company based in Singapore.

My main responsibility is to develop & maintain high performance backend system for real-time voice communication app on Android & iOS. SmartWalkie is a Walkie Talkie App on custom Android phones that doesn't have limitation of regular walkie-talkies.
