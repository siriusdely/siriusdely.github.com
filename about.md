I am a software developer for web and mobile application. I have been working professionally since 2009, and then remotely since 2016. My early years spent on working for software consultancy companies from where I gained experience from hiring & leading own team, write code, and deal with clients directly; also with extra physical office setup, admin, and offshore legalities.

Nowadays, I spend my time deepening and broadening my software development skills. I have a strong curiosity for information technology and engineering in general. I usually spend hours exploring and tinkering.

Currently, I am working for a Singapore-based push-to-talk app company, whose customers include well-known hotels, taxis, and cargos. My responsibility is on the core server application for receiving and sending the voices. I have significantly improved the performance and reliability of the system with relatively minimum additional operational cost.
